[h1]About[/h1]
99.9% of the work was done by the original author. This is just a continuation of the mod whose author has abandoned it. Check it out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1840010432]here.[/url]

[h1]Changes from the original[/h1]
- When full executed automation if selected the selected default species is not random anymore, instead it is the most populous species.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Monologue of a certain administrator:
"Increasing immigrants, sprawling species list; has modified species again and again but more immigrants are coming, and species list are getting longer. Athough the Welfare Minister directed to change living standard of starfishes, it takes much labor to find them from the list. I have moved to this emmpire and am working as administrator because I want to be released from complex government systems of my empire with Byzantine Bureaucracy, but the complexities between 2 empires make no difference! Oh, half-species..., someone picked Xeno-Compatibility ascension park. The species list will surely be longer and longer."

This mod modify automatically all sub-species in each species group, and only 1 sub-species remains for each species group, So, you will be released from complex species management. Eh, diversity? I cannot understand that means.

Following "Usage" and "Footnote" are same description as above pictures.

[h1Usage[/h1]
The way to use this mod is followings

[olist]
[*]Reserch "Gene Tailoring" technology, then "Gene Assimilation" is added to policy.
[*]Set this policy to "Executed" or "Full Executed".
[*]Modify species manually, and the post-modification sub-species will be set to the standard of this species group. Modify once for each species group.
[*]After this, all sub-species in the species group will be assimilated to the standard sub-species.
[list]
[*]Society Research 100 per 1 pop will be deducted from monthly income
[/list]
[/olist]        
[list]
[*]In case there are species groups unmodified manually:
[list]
[*]sub-species in this group will NOT be modified if the policy set to "Executed".
[*]most populous sub-species will be set to the standard and gene assimilation will start if policy set to "Fully Executed". 
[/list]
[/list]


[h1]Footnote[/h1]
[list]
[*]These empire cannot use gene assimilation:
	[list]
	[*]Hive-Mind, Machine
	[*]Has "Xeno-Compatibility" or "Synthetic Evolution" ascension park 
	[/list]
[*]These species/pops will not be assimialted:
[*]Machine units, robots, drones of hive-mind, self-modified ones, purged pops
[*]The game system does NOT consider gene assimilation of this mod as assimilation.
	[list]
	[*]Pops can work also while the gene assimilation is ongoing.
	[*]"Assimilation" species right is NOT required for the gene assimilation.
